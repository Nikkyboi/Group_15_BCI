1st model had every feature selected:
- apply_bandpass=True
- apply_car=True
- apply_z_score=True

2nd can't remember

3rd closer to paper: 59%
- apply_bandpass=False
- apply_car=True
- apply_ea=False
- apply_z_score=True

EA did not improve cross-subject but did subwhat improve within

4th model will try to add class weight for more balance:
weights = torch.tensor([1.0, 1.3], device=device)
loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weights)

also use shorter windows. Full trial is 6 sec, so centered in the middle 1-5 sec 52%
